<!-- 
	This file lists available web parser classes. It is used during runtime to get a list of
	all available parser classes and subsequently to call each of the classes to see whether
	or not it is capable of decoding a specific website. Each of the web parser classes listed
	here must implement the interface IWebParser and provide a method canExecute() and parse().
	canExecute is used as a check if the parser is capable of decoding a site and parse is the
	actual decoder method.
	
	The general idea is to have specific parser for specific sites, so that we can extract the
	relevant content from a site without bringing all the boilerplate into the database. 
	Therefore, whenever you create a new parser, list it in this file BUT place it above the 
	last parser SimpleWebParser. SimpleWebParser is the failsave parser. All it does is extract
	30 words before and 30 words after a given track term and return that snippet. Due to this
	design SimpleWebParser will return always true from canExecute().
